Have you ever gotton a great background image off of google, only to find out that it has horrible resolution?
(Pixelated)

Then follow these instructions to make those pixels go to HD!

PLEASE make a new Google Presentation before doing this, and for now, name it "HD Desktop Backgrounds"

1. When you have an image selected, click on it (In google images) and click view image
   Even if it's blocked, go to the URL bar and copy the link that is in it.
2. Then in your presentation, Click "Insert"
3. Click "Image"
4. Click "By URL"
5. Paste that URL, and wait for the image to appear
6. If it is HD put it into the top left hand corner of the slide
7. Resize to fit the whole frame (Use bottom right resize square)
   If your Image does not size proportionally, make it as big as it gets right before it goes off the slide
8. Then click "Present"
9. WAIT for AT LEAST 7 seconds
10. Press Ctrl + The sixth button from the left on the top of the keybord (Change Window Key)
11. YOU ARE DONE! Now instead of pixelated images, you have high definition quality. Just change your background.

P.S. For proof, use the original way of getting an image (Right clicking and saving), and compare it to this method.
